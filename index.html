									<h3>1️⃣ What Is Mental Health?</h3>
									<p>Mental health refers to a person’s emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It influences how individuals think, feel, behave, and handle stress in daily life. Maintaining good mental health helps people function effectively, cope with challenges, and maintain healthy relationships.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>2️⃣ Why Mental Health Matters</h3>
									<p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. Poor mental well-being can affect academic performance, productivity, relationships, and overall quality of life. Taking care of mental health helps individuals stay balanced, motivated, and emotionally resilient.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>3️⃣ Common Mental Health Challenges</h3>
									<p>Many people experience mental health challenges such as stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout. These issues can arise due to academic pressure, work stress, lifestyle changes, or personal difficulties. Recognizing these challenges early can help in managing them effectively.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>4️⃣ Signs You Should Pay Attention To</h3>
									<p>Early signs of mental health concerns may include constant fatigue, difficulty concentrating, mood swings, social withdrawal, or changes in sleep and appetite. Being aware of these signs allows individuals to seek support before the problem worsens.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>5️⃣ Breaking the Stigma Around Mental Health</h3>
									<p>Stigma and misunderstanding often prevent people from discussing mental health openly. Encouraging conversations, spreading awareness, and showing empathy can help create a supportive environment where individuals feel safe seeking help.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>6️⃣ When and Where to Seek Help</h3>
									<p>Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Support can come from friends, family, counselors, or mental health professionals. When emotional distress interferes with daily life, reaching out for professional guidance is an important step toward recovery.</p>
