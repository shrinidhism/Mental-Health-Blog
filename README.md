Understanding Mental Health: A Static Awareness Blog.

Mental health plays a crucial role in an individual’s overall well-being, yet it is 
often misunderstood or neglected. Students and young adults frequently face 
academic pressure, stress, and emotional challenges, which can impact their 
mental health. This project aims to address the need for awareness and basic 
understanding of mental health through a static informational blog. The website 
focuses on educating users, reducing stigma, and providing simple coping tips and 
reliable resources.
