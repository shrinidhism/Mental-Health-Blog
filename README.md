Understanding Mental Health: A Static Awareness Blog.

Mental health plays a crucial role in an individual’s overall well-being, yet it is 
often misunderstood or neglected. Students and young adults frequently face 
academic pressure, stress, and emotional challenges, which can impact their 
mental health. This project aims to address the need for awareness and basic 
understanding of mental health through a static informational blog. The website 
focuses on educating users, reducing stigma, and providing simple coping tips and 
reliable resources.

Scope of the Project: 
The project covers the design and development of a static blog-style website 
focused on mental health awareness. It includes informational content, coping 
tips, and external support resources. The project does not include user interaction, 
data collection, or backend functionality. The intended users are students and 
individuals seeking basic mental health awareness. 

Problem Statement: 
Lack of awareness and accessible information about mental health often leads to 
misunderstanding, stigma, and neglect of emotional well-being. There is a need 
for a simple and reliable platform that provides mental health information in an 
easy-to-understand format.
